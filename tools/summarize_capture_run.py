"""Summarise one capture run directory (clg400-trace-*.json).

One line of counts per stage that a campaign has to keep apart: attempts,
captured, failed (by the stage that failed), CRC-valid, packets the detector
accepted only through its straddle-tolerant path (joint status bit 5, M7) and
what became of those. A failed attempt carries the IQ's burst ratio when the
recording finished, which is what separates "no packet on the air" from "the
packet was there and the PL never detected it". On the M8 diagnostic image
every record also carries the receive crossing's drop count since boot; the
summary reports how many samples the series lost and between which attempts,
and on which misses the decision history was read.

With --planned-attempts N the summary also accounts for records that are
missing altogether (the run stopped early, a record was deleted) and exits
non-zero unless every planned attempt has a record and every record is
classifiable, so a partial campaign cannot pass for a complete one.
