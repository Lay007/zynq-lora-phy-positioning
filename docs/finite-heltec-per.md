# Finite ZynqSDR to Heltec V4 or LilyGO LR1121 trials

Use `firmware/heltec-v4-sx1262-rx` on the ESP32-S3/SX1262 Heltec V4.
Version 0.2.0 prints the selected LDRO state and `rx_packets` in `PROFILE`.
LDRO is explicitly set after SF/BW/CR, so source and receiver use the same
packet geometry. The host verifies the profile before transmitting.

The same serial protocol is provided by
`firmware/lilygo-t3s3-lr1121-rx` version 0.2.0 for the standard T3-S3 LR1121
board. This version explicitly selects LDRO after changing SF/BW/CR and
reports `rx_packets`, including CRC failures, in `PROFILE`. Use the Sub-GHz
RF path for 868.1 MHz. Build/upload from that firmware directory and replace
the example COM port with the actual LilyGO port. Verify the board revision
and RF-switch wiring before using this firmware on an external-PA variant.

Connect ZynqSDR TX1 through the bench's attenuators to the Heltec RF input;
connect Heltec USB to the host. Keep the RF profile and attenuation in the
measurement record. Build and upload from the firmware directory:

```powershell
pio run
pio run -t upload --upload-port COM7
```

Replace COM7 with the actual Heltec port. Build the finite ARM transmitter
using `tools/build_per_tools.py` with the board's ARM Linux toolchain and
retain `per-tools-manifest.json`. Preserve a verified SSH host-key file.

Start with a small high-SNR packet-compatibility test, then sweep SNR:

```powershell
python tools/finite_per_measure.py --receiver COM7 --sf 7 --bw 125 --cr 1 `
  --packets 8 --snr 20 --gap 0.3 --restore-profile `
  --known-hosts artifacts/known_hosts --bin-dir artifacts/per-bin `
  --out artifacts/heltec-sf7-bw125-cr1-smoke.json
```

The serial branch supports SF7–12, BW125/250/500 kHz and CR1–4 (wire coding
rates 4/5–4/8). The PL branch remains SF7/BW125: other profiles require a
different generated FPGA receiver. Command-line parameters do not reconfigure
its FFT/reference/detector.

The denominator is the entire planned ID range, including losses at both
edges. A CRC-valid packet must also have the exact expected payload. All
serial records, generator summaries, writer exit statuses and profile replies
are retained. Missing serial counters, including a lost final line, invalidate
the point instead of becoming apparent RF losses. Serial timeout fragments
are buffered until a complete line arrives. CRC failures remain records.
Zero received RF packets is a valid PER=1 point if TX and serial collection
completed. A failed/interrupted transmitter produces no PER.

The PL trace decoder requires a payload-CRC-enabled header before ranking
hypotheses; a noisy header that disables CRC cannot bypass this policy.
Both PL and serial collectors compare the full payload to the planned
32-byte `ZLP1` frame. A CRC-valid frame with a known ID but corrupted content
is a packet error, not a successful reception or an acquisition failure.
Its timestamp is excluded from ToA repeatability. PL summaries made from
older parsed records without payload bytes must be regenerated from raw traces.

By default, a CRC/readData-success output without a recognizable planned ID
invalidates the point as foreign traffic. A controlled conducted delivery test
may explicitly select `--allow-unrecognized-rx`: unknown or empty outputs are
retained and counted separately, while only exact planned payloads add successes.
This measures delivered-packet PER, including receiver firmware/buffer failures;
it does not identify an unknown output as unrelated traffic or as an RF error.
Final counter continuity, complete finite TX and exact payload checks remain
mandatory. State the selected policy with the results; do not use the option
to qualify uncontrolled over-the-air sensitivity trials.

LR1121 RX firmware 0.2.1 also records IRQ, RX_DONE, RX buffer offset and the
CRC-presence flag read from the last explicit header before clearing its buffer.
If this metadata is present, the host requires RX_DONE, a successful header
query and CRC enabled in addition to readData success. Older logs retain their
legacy parsing and cannot retroactively prove the missing metadata. RadioLib
readData success alone does not establish a correct delivered payload.

LR1121 RX firmware 0.2.2 records the internal radio hardware/device/firmware
version and supports `set empty_recovery on|off` (default on). After reporting
a zero-length reception unchanged, recovery reinitializes the radio, restores
the selected profile and RF switch, then restarts reception. `RECOVERY` lines
and the `empty_recoveries` profile counter identify these receive gaps. Counter
reset clears the packet/recovery counts; `reset radio` preserves them and the
profile. If reinitialization fails, reception remains stopped and reports an
error. This is a configurable recovery hypothesis for persistent buffer shifts,
not proof of their chip-level cause. Include recovery-induced losses in the
planned transmission denominator, and keep on/off trials separate. The receiver
never shifts payload bytes to manufacture a matching packet.

Long SF12 waveforms need small batches: templates are uploaded to the board's
RAM filesystem. The harness checks batch size and available space before TX.
Use distinct `--first-sequence` ranges and preserve each finite batch before
aggregating counts. Do not average batches with unequal denominators.
For repeated SNR points of one batch, `--template-cache-dir
/tmp/lora-finite-cache-<32 hex digits>` may retain one owned template between
invocations. Every reuse verifies its SHA-256 against the host template; a
mismatch retires only that cache file and forces a verified upload. A matching
template is hard-linked to the finite run and needs no second RAM-sized copy.
The caller retires the cache file and its directory after the campaign. Per-run
source snapshots, TX seeds, generator summaries and counters are still retained.
Report binomial uncertainty: zero losses in N trials has a one-sided 95%
upper bound `1 - 0.05**(1/N)`, approximately 3/N.

The injected SNR is defined digitally in BW before the DAC. It is not a
measurement of absolute receiver-input sensitivity; characterize the RF
filters, actual sample rate, attenuation and noise floor for that claim.
The offline `lora_tx_waveform.py` noisy-stream mode now widens its noise
passband for BW500; older versions cut noise off at 150 kHz and understated
noise power in that bandwidth. The finite C generator is white over Fs.

## Ideal reference curves with explicit bandwidth

```shell
python tools/lora_per_ideal.py --sf 7 8 9 10 11 12 --cr 1 2 3 4 \
  --bw 125 250 500 --packets 1000 --demodulator exact-decision \
  --out artifacts/per-ideal-modes.json
python tools/plot_per_modes.py artifacts/per-ideal-modes.json --out artifacts/per-figures
```

`exact-decision` samples the Rician correct FFT bin and the exact maximum of
the other exponential bin powers, then uses the real FEC/header/CRC decoder.
Tests compare independent draws with waveform/FFT Monte Carlo. This is an
ideal perfect-timing/no-CFO AWGN model, not a hardware measurement. Identical
SF/CR/LDRO profiles share normalized trials across BW; changing LDRO requires
a different packet simulation. Figures show pointwise Wilson intervals and
upper bounds when no losses were observed.
