    // the N-point spectrum has two comparable peaks; the peak tracker returns
    // whichever is larger. For arrivals a little past half a symbol (about
    // 9% of arrival phases, measured by replaying board IQ through this RTL
    // at every phase) it returns the preamble half: the first sync symbol
    // shows up as one extra preamble bin, and the second sync symbol is read
    // correctly. The generated detector needs preamble+8*highNibble at that
    // position and so never fires, and the packet is lost for good: the sync
    // word cannot be seen again on this grid.
    //
    // The pattern is [8 x ref][ref][ref + 8*lowNibble] instead of
    // [8 x ref][ref + 8*highNibble][ref + 8*lowNibble]. Accepting it as well,
    // with the same +/-1 bin tolerance and the same ten-symbol window, adds
    // no detection where the generated rule already fires: the two sync
    // patterns differ in the ninth symbol by 8*highNibble bins, so at most
    // one of them can match (a sync word with highNibble 0 makes them
    // identical and this path adds nothing). No generated file is edited;
    // this is combinational in the same cycle as symbol_valid, like the
    // generated detected, because lora_detector_timestamp_align requires the
    // decision on the matching timestamp cycle.
    //
    // Two guards, both found the hard way on the first board run of this
    // path (5 of its 12 rescued packets were false detections):
    //
    //  * Every decision in the window must have come from a correlator that
    //    saw a signal. In silence the correlator's spectrum is exactly zero
    //    and its argmax is bin 0, so eight "equal" bins and a ninth equal
    //    bin cost nothing, and the decision for the first, partial window of
    //    the next packet then needs only ONE coincidence (16 +/- 1 bins,
    //    about 2.3%) instead of the generated rule's two. peak, spectrum sum
    //    and confidence were all exactly 0 on every silent decision of
    //    board recordings from 25 dB to the 50 dB set, and non-zero on every
    //    decision of a real preamble or sync window, so "peak != 0" is a
    //    clean test. A false detection there arms the trace and the grid
    //    resync on the wrong instant and garbles the joint estimate.
    //  * The reference bin must lie near half a symbol (N/4 .. 3N/4). The
    //    straddle happens only when the packet's arrival is about half a
    //    symbol from the correlator window, which is what the bin measures;
