# Return the AD9361 to the LoRa receive profile after a cold boot.
#
# The transceiver comes up at 30.72 MS/s with a bypassed filter chain, and the
# LoRa receiver needs exact 1 MS/s. Only IIO sysfs attributes of the transceiver
# are written. This script never touches QSPI, the boot loader, the FPGA
# manager, the PL control registers, or any RF transmit enable; the two FIR
# enables it writes select the digital filter chain, not an RF output.
#
# The order matters and getting it wrong returns EINVAL rather than anything
# descriptive. This follows ad9361_set_bb_rate() from libad9361-iio -- park at
# 3 MS/s with the filter bypassed and load the 128-tap decimate- and
# interpolate-by-4 filter -- with one correction for this board's driver: both
# filter enables are written, and both before the target rate, because at
# 1 MS/s the chain is only legal with the receive FIR decimating.
#
# The rate is parked *before* the FIR is bypassed, not after: on a cold boot
# the transceiver is already above the park rate with the filter bypassed, so
# either order looks fine there. Re-running this script against a board
# already sitting at the 1 MS/s profile (e.g. only to change gain) is a
# different starting point -- bypassing the FIR while still at 1 MS/s is the
# same illegal combination the comment above already names, just approached
# from the other side, and fails with the same bare EINVAL.
#
# Reordering alone was not enough, measured live: even with the rate already
# parked, bypassing the FIR immediately afterward -- both writes in the same
# shell, no delay -- still failed with the same bare EINVAL. A fixed settle
# delay after the park was tried next and was not reliable either: 0.2 s was
# enough in some trials and not others, and a failing write's exit status
# turned out not to mean the value was rejected -- one run's `echo 0 >
# out_voltage_filter_fir_en` reported the same write error and still left
# the attribute reading back 0. So the write's own exit status is not what
# to trust here; the readback is. set_fir below writes, ignores that write's
# reported status, and polls the readback with a short retry budget instead
# of a guessed delay.
