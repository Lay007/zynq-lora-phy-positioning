# Contributing

## Development workflow

1. Open an issue or describe the measurable outcome of the change.
2. Add or update the authoritative MATLAB floating-point behavior.
3. Add deterministic MATLAB tests, including a boundary or impairment case.
4. Update the Simulink implementation only after the MATLAB behavior is stable.
5. Compare generated Verilog against versioned MATLAB/Simulink golden vectors.
6. Update the relevant architecture, experiment, or calibration notes.

Run the local checks before committing:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

For the authoritative model, run in MATLAB:

```matlab
cd model/matlab
results = run_tests;
assertSuccess(results);
```

## Commit policy

Keep commits small and outcome-oriented. The subject should answer **what was done**,
not describe an intention or a future task. Prefer result wording such as:

```text
Добавлена проверка CDC метаданных
Исправлено выравнивание packet timestamp
Обновлено описание golden regression
```

Avoid combining unrelated RTL, model, documentation, and infrastructure changes in one
commit when they can be reviewed independently.

Work on the default `main` branch unless the task explicitly names another branch. Historical
or experimental branches, including `lora_cpp`, must not be used as an implicit target for
new changes, rebases, merges, or cleanup.

## Evidence vocabulary

Use the narrowest claim supported by the evidence:

- MATLAB/Python test pass = model/reference evidence;
- Icarus/XSim pass = RTL simulation evidence;
- synthesis report = synthesis evidence only;
- routed timing report = implementation evidence only;
- bitstream/XSA generation = build evidence, not hardware acceptance;
- boot or DMA smoke = board connectivity evidence;
- RF/packet/ToA claim requires the corresponding measured hardware evidence.

Do not turn a green simulation or implementation job into a board-level claim in commit
messages, README text, issues, or reports.

## Engineering conventions

- Store SI units in field names where ambiguity is possible (`sample_rate_hz`,
  `toa_s`, `position_m`).
- Record random seeds for generated signals and noise.
- Keep generated runs under ignored `artifacts/`. Promote only reviewed,
  redistributable IQ evidence to `captures/reference/`; raw `.cf32`, `.cu8`,
  and `.cfile` data there must use Git LFS and include provenance plus SHA-256.
- Never overwrite raw experiment data. Derived results belong in a new output
  directory with their configuration and software revision.
- Document fixed-point scaling and rounding for every PL interface.
- Do not edit HDL Coder output manually; change the Simulink source or its HDL
  configuration and regenerate Verilog.
